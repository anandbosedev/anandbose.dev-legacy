An experimentation of safely migrating signing keys for Android apps, without losing trust to the previous keys.

From the Android developer documentation:

> Android 9 (API level 28) supports APK key rotation, which gives apps the ability to change their signing key as part of an APK update. To make rotation practical, APKs must indicate levels of trust between the new and old signing key. To support key rotation, we updated the APK signature scheme from v2 to v3 to allow the new and old keys to be used. V3 adds information about the supported SDK versions and a proof-of-rotation struct to the APK signing block. 

> Devices running Android 8.1 (API level 27) or lower don't support changing the signing certificate. If your app's minSdkVersion is 27 or lower, use an old signing certificate to sign your app in addition to the new signature.

This breaks down to these minority use cases:
- You are targetting your app for Android 9 or later. 
- Your keystore is going to expire soon. Still you are supporting the project, and have to publish updates.
- The project is handed over to a new company, and they have to use their key to sign the updates.

However, it doesn't mean to solve these situations:
- Loss of keystore.
- Signing apps which targets Android prior to 9 (Pie, API 28).

The introduction of key rotation have minor impact around the developers for now, and most of us don't really care about it. But the cryptographic advancements over the APK siging schemes from v1 to v4 is appreciable. The APK signing scheme v2 detects the tampering of zip central directory, and also improve the speed of installation. V3 introduced key rotation and the ability to sign with multiple keystores. The preview V4 scheme produces a new kind of signature in a separate file (apk-name.apk.idsig). This scheme supports ADB incremental APK installation, which speeds up APK install.

For better understanding, here is an illustrative example.

### Let's get started
Let's start with an unsigned build of the application `app-release-unsigned.apk`.
First of all, let's create a keystore with `keytool`. Here's how.

```
$ keytool -genkeypair \     
> -alias first \
> -keyalg RSA \
> -keysize 4096 \
> -validity 10000 \
> -keypass ******** \
> -keystore first.jks \
> -storepass ******** \
> -storetype PKCS12

What is your first and last name?
  [Unknown]:  First
What is the name of your organizational unit?
  [Unknown]:  Example
What is the name of your organization?
  [Unknown]:  Example
What is the name of your City or Locality?
  [Unknown]:  Example
What is the name of your State or Province?
  [Unknown]:  Example
What is the two-letter country code for this unit?
  [Unknown]:  IN
Is CN=First, OU=Example, O=Example, L=Example, ST=Example, C=IN correct?
  [no]:  yes
```
Next, sign your application with the keystore `first.jks`.
```
$ apksigner sign \
> --ks first.jks \
> --in app-release-unsigned.apk \
> --out app-first.apk
Keystore password for signer #1: ********
```
Now, you have your application signed with `first.jks` to `app-first.jks`. Generate your second keystore `second.jks`.
```
$ keytool -genkeypair \
> -alias second \
> -keyalg RSA \
> -keysize 4096 \
> -validity 10000 \
> -keypass ******** \
> -keystore second.jks \
> -storepass ******** \
> -storetype PKCS12
```
This will ask the same questions as asked when you created the first key. After that, sign your app with second key to `app-second.apk`.
```
$ apksigner sign \  
> --ks second.jks \
> --in app-release-unsigned.apk \
> --out app-second.apk
Keystore password for signer #1: ********
```
All right. Now, verify the both apps are signed with the correct keys.
```
$ apksigner verify -v --print-certs app-first.apk

```
Let's try to install the signed apps.
```
$ adb install app-first.apk 
Performing Streamed Install
Success
$ adb install app-second.apk
Performing Streamed Install
adb: failed to install app-second.apk: Failure [INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE: Package com.example.app signatures do not match previously installed version; ignoring!]
```
This is usual. Both of the apps have same package identifiers and different signatures. Android forbids update if signature mismatches.
 
_Android accepts the APK only if it proves the trust with older signing keys. APK Signature Scheme v3 introduces the facility to do this. With the `apksigner` utility, we have to rotate the key to create a signing certificate lineage and sign the APK. It includes the proof that the new key has a relationship to the old key._
```
$ apksigner rotate \
> --old-signer --ks first.jks \
> --new-signer --ks second.jks \
> --out lineage-1-2         
Keystore password for old signer: ********
Keystore password for new signer: ********
```
Now we sign the APK with the new signer `second.jks` keystore, provided the old keystore `first.jks` and the signing certificate lineage of the keystores.
```
$ apksigner sign \
> --ks first.jks \
> --next-signer --ks second.jks \
> --lineage lineage-1-2 \
> --in app-release-unsigned.apk \
> --out app-rotated-1-2.apk
Keystore password for signer #1: ********
Keystore password for signer #2: ********
```
All right. Let's take a look on the signature of `app-rotated-1-2.apk`
```
$ apksigner verify -v --print-certs app-rotated-1-2.apk
Verifies
Verified using v1 scheme (JAR signing): true
Verified using v2 scheme (APK Signature Scheme v2): true

```
The signature looks exactly like from the `app-second.apk`. Let's install over the `app-first.apk`.
```
$ adb install app-rotated-1-2.apk 
Performing Streamed Install
Success
```

The rotated APK installs fine for the Androids before 9.0 Pie API 28. For previous Androids, `-r` flag is necessary. It tells the package manager to re-install the package. For Android Pie 9.0 and later, it is also possible to install `app-second.apk` after `app-rotated-1-2.apk`. This is because the `app-rotated-1-2.apk` proves the new signature belongs to the same developer, and further installations will requires signing from the new keystore only.

For the earlier versions of Android, the future updates will requires to be signed with the previous keystore and the signing certificate lineage, which invalidates the benefit of key rotation. I hope Google will find a solution for that.

### Rotate it again
What will have to do if you want to publish updates with a newer keystore `third.jks`? Rotate it again, with older keystores along the previous signing certificate lineage.
```
$ apksigner rotate \     
> --in lineage-1-2 \
> --out lineage-1-2-3 \
> --old-signer --ks second.jks \
> --new-signer --ks third.jks
Keystore password for old signer: ********
Keystore password for new signer: ********
```
This will generate a new signing certificate lineage, which proves the `third.jks` keystore belongs to the family of `first.jks` and `second.jks`. Now sign with the latest keystore `third.jks`, previous keystore `second.jks` and the latest signing certificate lineage `lineage-1-2-3`.
```
$ apksigner sign \
> --ks first.jks \
> --next-signer --ks second.jks \
> --next-signer --ks third.jks \
> --lineage lineage-1-2-3 \
> --in app-release-unsigned.apk \
> --out app-rotated-2-3.apk
Keystore password for signer #1: ********
Keystore password for signer #2: ********
Keystore password for signer #3: ********
```
The rotated APK will have signature by `third.jks` keystore, but includes the proof that it can be verified over `app-first.apk` and `app-second.apk`.
```
apksigner verify -v --print-certs app-rotated-2-3.apk 
Verifies
Verified using v1 scheme (JAR signing): true
Verified using v2 scheme (APK Signature Scheme v2): true
Verified using v3 scheme (APK Signature Scheme v3): true
Number of signers: 1
Signer #1 certificate DN: CN=Third, OU=Example, O=Example, L=Example, ST=Example, C=IN
Signer #1 certificate SHA-256 digest: 046b1a6ae24f12b2d7d2938d7054c06bac308c672981f1bea38d40afb9c23984

Signer #1 certificate MD5 digest: 688f275d697fe3630ad377d7ffa8d6e5
Signer #1 key algorithm: RSA
Signer #1 key size (bits): 4096
Signer #1 public key SHA-256 digest: 11f007348e9bc258207c58a819c3ffbde118d99c7f3ecf6fd6ec94db18f768a7

Signer #1 public key MD5 digest: a1c68cc9d3a02954d2ceeeef06f5b3c1
.... (output redacted for brevity)
```
Finally, install over the `app-second.apk`
```
$ adb install app-rotated-2-3.apk 
Performing Streamed Install
Success
```
Yay! For Android 9.0 Pie or later, the further updates required to be signed with the `third.jks` keystore only. But make sure that you have to keep the signing certificate lineage forever, because in case you have to use a new keystore, you will need it.
```
$ adb install app-third.apk 
Performing Streamed Install
Success
```
